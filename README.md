# magritte

_Ceci n'est pas une pipe._

> An implementation of a logic-based time series analysis approach.

As self declared, magritte is not a pipeline (at least no in the canonical
sense), even though a visualization would clearly look like one. It is
asynchronous on all paths, and it takes care of everything from data
acquisition to storing results in an easy-to-visualize manner.

## What else is it not?

Unless you are interested for the purpose of learning, this is not something
you should be looking at. In other words, **don't use this in prod**.
